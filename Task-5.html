            <h3>About Tesla </h3>
            <p><b>Tesla,</b> Inc.
            is an American electric vehicle and clean energy company based in
           Palo Alto, California, United States, with plans to move its headquarters to Austin,
           Texas in the future. Tesla designs and manufactures electric cars, battery energy storage
            from home to grid-scale, solar panels and solar roof tiles, and related products and services.
             In 2020, Tesla had the most sales of battery electric vehicles and plug-in electric vehicles, 
             capturing 16% of the plug-in market (which includes plug-in hybrids) and 23% of the
              battery-electric (purely electric) market. Through its subsidiary Tesla Energy, the
               company develops and is a major installer of photovoltaic systems in the United States. 
               Tesla Energy is also one of the largest global suppliers of battery energy storage systems, 
               with 3 gigawatt-hours (GWh) installed in 2020.</p></div>

        <h3>Tesla Founders </h3>
        <p>The company was incorporated as Tesla Motors, Inc. on July 1, 2003, by Martin Eberhard
             and Marc Tarpenning. Eberhard and Tarpenning served as CEO and CFO, respectively.
              Eberhard said he wanted to build "a car manufacturer that is also a technology company",
               with its core technologies as "the battery, the computer software, and the proprietary 
               motor".</p>

        <p>Ian Wright was Tesla's third employee, joining a few months later. In February 2004, the
             company raised US$7.5 million in series A funding, including $6.5 million from Elon Musk,
              who had received $100 million from the sale of his interest in PayPal two years earlier.
               Musk became the chairman of the board of directors and the largest shareholder of Tesla.
                J. B. Straubel joined Tesla in May 2004 as Chief Technical Officer.</p>

            <div class="text-1">
                <p>The Tesla Roadster is a battery electric vehicle (BEV) sports car, 
                    based on the Lotus Elise chassis, that was produced by the electric car 
                    firm Tesla Motors (now Tesla, Inc.) in California from 2008 to 2012. The 
                    Roadster was the first highway legal serial production all-electric car to 
                    use lithium-ion battery cells and the first production all-electric car to 
                    travel more than 320 kilometres (200 mi) per charge.[7] It is also the first 
                    production car to be launched into deep space, carried by a Falcon Heavy 
                    rocket in a test flight on February 6, 2018.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="text-2">
                <p>Musk took an active role within the company and oversaw Roadster product design at 
                    a detailed level, but was not deeply involved in day-to-day business operations. 
                    From the beginning, Musk consistently maintained that Tesla's long-term goal was to 
                    create affordable mass market electric vehicles.[14] The company’s strategy was to start
                     with a premium sports car aimed at early adopters and then move into more mainstream 
                     vehicles, including sedans and affordable compacts.[15]</p>

                    the Model S as its flagship.</p>
                <p>In 2013, the Model S became the first electric car to top the monthly new-car-sales ranking 
                    in any country, leading twice in Norway, in September and December 2013 and 
                    in Denmark in December 2015.[17] Sales passed 250,000 units in September 2018. The Model S 
                    was the top-selling plug-in electric car worldwide in 2015 and 2016, although it was 
                    later surpassed by the Model 3.</p>
